Good Smelling Car

I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire, exhale desire
I know it's dire, my time today

I have these thoughts so often, I ought
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in my car

The car smells really good
I don´t actually need a radio
The car smells really good

But it smells really good
